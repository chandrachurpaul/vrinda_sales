Vrinda Store Analysis (MS Excel Dashboard)

I created an interactive dashboard in MS Excel that depicts the Annual Sales Report of Vrinda Store, an E-commerce Store to solve a business problem. I performed data cleaning, data processing and data analysis on raw sales data.
Also, I used nested-If and text extraction formulae to process data. Following that, I created Pivot Tables to create pivot charts, which were used to create the charts in the dashboard.
Finally, I used slicers in the dashboard so that the final user can gather more insights as per his/her requirement. I used Filters in order to clean data as well.
